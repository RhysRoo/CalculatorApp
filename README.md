<h1>Welcome to My SwiftUI Calculator</h1>

<p>The project uses <b>State Management</b> to change the state on the displays interface. @State properites are used to manage and store the apps data.</p>

<p>Experimented with <b>Safe Unwrapping</b> to prevent the app from crashing. I learnt that if let was the most benefical way to mitigate this. This is because I orinigally used (display += first!). Although the code worked, I felt like this was bad practice as with if let can post errors or do other conditions instead of crashing.</p>
